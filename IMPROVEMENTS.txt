StockingReport.com - Improvements & Roadmap
Current Status
What's Working Well ✅

Clean, professional design with Tailwind CSS
Robust PDF scraping and parsing logic
Static JSON architecture for efficiency
Interactive map with Leaflet
SEO-friendly with sitemap generation and individual water body pages
Smart incremental daily updates
Manual coordinate overrides for geocoding accuracy
Automated data cleanup to merge duplicates and fix malformed names
Intelligent PDF URL system with automatic validation and fallback
Automatic PDF downloads and archiving
Clean 168 water bodies with 5,900+ unique stocking records


Recently Completed Improvements ✅ (November 2024)

1. Data Quality & Cleanup
   ✅ Fixed 168 water body names (merged duplicates like "Tree Lake" + "Trees Lake")
   ✅ Removed malformed entries with quantity numbers and coordinate fragments
   ✅ Rescued data from malformed entries by merging with clean versions
   ✅ Fixed truncated names like "Rock Lake Hatchery Kid's Pond's (Near Ro"
   ✅ Automated cleanup process runs after every data update

2. PDF Link Management
   ✅ Fixed 5,657 broken PDF links that used invalid local:// protocol
   ✅ Removed 933 duplicate records (same report with multiple URLs)
   ✅ Implemented smart URL preference: NMDGF > local copies
   ✅ Historical PDFs (2020-2025) hosted in public/reports/ directory
   ✅ Recent reports link to official NMDGF website for credibility

3. Intelligent URL Validation System
   ✅ Automatic PDF downloads during weekly updates
   ✅ URL validation with HTTP HEAD requests (checks if NMDGF links still work)
   ✅ Automatic fallback to local copies when NMDGF removes old reports
   ✅ Validation caching to avoid repeated checks
   ✅ Downloads PDFs to both downloaded_pdfs/ (archive) and public/reports/ (web)
   ✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated to commit PDFs automatically

4. Search & UX Improvements
   ✅ Keyboard navigation in search dropdown (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
   ✅ Visual feedback for keyboard-selected options
   ✅ Smooth scrolling in dropdown list
   ✅ Hover effects with padding animation

5. Fishing Regulations Integration ✅
   ✅ Automated regulation fetching from NM Game & Fish ArcGIS Feature Service
   ✅ Created fetch_regulations.py to query 7 regulation layers via REST API
   ✅ Created match_regulations.py for fuzzy string matching water names
   ✅ Manual mapping system for water name variations (Rio vs River)
   ✅ Chile designation image display (Green, Red, X-mas Chile Waters)
   ✅ Official NMDGF designation logos in /public/images/designations/
   ✅ Regulation HTML generation with tackle rules, bag limits, species info
   ✅ Weekly automation integration (fetches fresh regulations automatically)
   ✅ 14 water bodies now display special regulations (out of 43 with regulations)
   ✅ Disclaimer linking to official NM Game & Fish for accuracy
   ✅ Data files: regulations_data.json, regulations_raw.json, matched_regulations.json


Issues to Fix 🔴
1. Missing Web Server - Future
Option 2: Add Flask Server (Future-Proofing)

Pros: Can add features like email notifications, user accounts, API endpoints
Cons: Slightly more complex, may cost more on Render
When to use: If you plan to add premium features



High Priority Improvements 📈
Performance & Caching

 Add HTTP caching headers for static assets
 Implement response compression (gzip)
 Consider lazy loading for older stocking records
 Optimize background image (host locally, use WebP)

User Experience

 ✅ Add skeleton loaders instead of "Loading Data..." text - COMPLETED
 Improve error states when data fails to load
 Add "Clear search" button
 ✅ Implement keyboard navigation in dropdown (arrow keys) - COMPLETED
 Make map height responsive for mobile devices
 Add breadcrumb navigation on detail pages
 Add "Back to Map" button on detail pages
 Show metadata on detail pages (total stockings, date range, species count)

Search Functionality

 ✅ Add fuzzy search (Fuse.js library) - COMPLETED
 Add species filter in dropdown
 Track popular searches with Google Analytics events
 Add "no results" message when search returns empty

Mobile Optimization

 Test on actual devices
 Adjust map height for mobile (currently 400px)
 Ensure touch targets are large enough (currently too small)
 Test dropdown behavior on mobile


Medium Priority Improvements 🎯
Features

 Favorites System - Use localStorage to save favorite waters
 Email Notifications - Alert users when specific waters are stocked
 Recent Stockings Widget - Add species breakdown to summary
 Export to Calendar - Generate .ics files for stocking dates
 Better Date Formatting - Use relative dates ("2 days ago")

Data & Analytics

 Track which water bodies are searched most
 Track which species are most popular
 Add analytics events for user interactions
 Create monthly reports on stocking patterns

SEO Improvements

 Add structured data (Schema.org JSON-LD)
 Create unique meta descriptions for each water body
 Add robots.txt file
 Add canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content
 Submit sitemap to Google Search Console


Low Priority (Nice to Have) 💡
Advanced Features

 Historical charts showing stocking frequency (Chart.js)
 Weather integration (OpenWeatherMap API)
 User-generated content (fishing reports, conditions)
 Social sharing buttons
 Dark mode toggle
 Print-friendly layouts

Data Enhancements

 Add driving directions to each location
 Show nearby water bodies
